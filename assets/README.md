# an-hour-out
My wife is a writer, so I'm putting together a travel blog for her. It covers all the things you can do within an hour of Richmond, VA.
This is just a little pet project that I'm working on as I develop my skills (so expect a ton of commits as I learn new things and want to test them out in a non-tutorial environment).

Enjoy!
